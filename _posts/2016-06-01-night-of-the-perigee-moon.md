All Tilly Angelica wants for her thirteenth birthday is to be normal! But with her changeover party looming and her mad, magical family coming from near and far, Tilly is set to inherit a terrifying - or tantalising - talent of her own.

As the enchanted Angelicas gather and Arial Manor becomes a madhouse, Tilly's troubles are tripled by her creepy cousin Prosper, and his sinister plot to bewitch the family by harnessing the powers of the Perigee Moon.

*Night of the Perigee Moon* is the winner of the 2013 Tom Fitzgibbon Award for a previously unpublished writer.
