A girl of mystery shouldn't be usual. And Frankie Potts, number-one detective in Tring, is anything but. She's got flaming red hair, a crazy grandma called Formidable Mildred, and a mystery list that keeps growing.

When Frankie is adopted by a dog outside her favourite sweet shop, there's detecting to be done.
