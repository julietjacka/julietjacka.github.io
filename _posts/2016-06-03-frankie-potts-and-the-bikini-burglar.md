*Book 2*

**A burglar is on the loose in Tring, and Frankie’s caseload gets out of control**

Frankie is on the lookout for a human detective sidekick to share her caseload. Finding the right person isn't as easy as you'd think, and she's never had more to juggle. Right now she's having to contend with a new boy from Borneo, whose tales are taller and wilder than his wild black hair; the meanest school office lady in Tring; her arch-enemy Ralph Peter-McGee and his equally brutish ginger tomcat; and helping her Grandma M train a troupe of greyhounds.

Meanwhile, Tring is on high alert — a burglar is on the loose. Random pink items, most notably a bikini belonging to Frankie's teacher, are disappearing from houses all over the village. An exhibition of bejewelled items is just about to open, with a pink, diamond-encrusted bikini as its showpiece. The temptation will be too great for any self-respecting burglar to stay away.

And self-respecting solver of mysteries Frankie is determined to catch the burglar in the act . . . but in her efforts to tidy up her mystery list single-handed, is Frankie ignoring some very important clues?
