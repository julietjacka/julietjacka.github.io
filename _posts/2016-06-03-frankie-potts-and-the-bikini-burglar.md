A girl of mystery shouldn't be usual. And Frankie Potts, number-one detective in Tring, is anything but. She's got flaming red hair, a crazy grandma called Formidable Mildred, and a mystery list that keeps growing.

A burglar is on the loose in Tring, and even with Sparkplug to help her, Frankie's caseload is out of control.
